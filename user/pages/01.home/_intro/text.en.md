## Welcome to the website of the Saxon Association of Sworn Interpreters and Translators

(Verein beeidigter Dolmetscher und Übersetzer Sachsen e.V.).

Our association was founded in the year 2000 as a membership organisation for sworn interpreters and translators. All of our members are authorised to produce certified translations and to interpret for official bodies such as the police, the courts, and public agencies.

We can provide a wide range of language-based services. These include:

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> Interpreting and translating for courts and official bodies

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> Other interpreting services

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> Translating documents, certificates and contracts

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> Technical translations

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> Translating audio recordings
 
We are all too well aware that the uninitiated can find the search for a suitable interpreter or translator a very time-consuming and bewildering experience, which is why we are happy to offer our assistance. Working with us ensures that the professional rights of our publicly appointed and officially accredited interpreters and translators are safeguarded.

**We are no translation agency.** Our job is it to connect you to the translator or interpreter you need, saving you time and helping you with our experience. After establishing contact, any further questions will be negotiated directly between you and a real person that can provide the services you need.

## The benefits to you of using the association’s services are that:

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> We can facilitate your search for a qualified interpreter or translator.

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> If work is commissioned, we will put you in direct touch with the interpreter or translator who will be acting on your behalf. This will enable you to make arrangements with them on a one-to-one basis, and to discuss any last-minute changes.

!!!! In addition to performing their day jobs, volunteers from the association also provide a telephone hotline service round the clock; call **<a href="tel:08008888833">0800 888 88 33</a>** (no fees, only working within Germany).

Alternatively, you can get in touch via our email address: bestellung@beeidigte-dolmetscher.de

We look forward to hearing from you, and will be happy to deal with your enquiry.
